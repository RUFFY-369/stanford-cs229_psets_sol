# Stanford-CS229:Machine Learning
This repo consists of my solutions to coding problems in Stanford's CS229 (Fall 2018) problem sets.

http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html

#### Dependencies : Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy(for ps4 & ps4(1))

Most of the solutions are in Jupyter notebook.For the pset4,I have also included another part named as ps4(1) in which Inverted pendulum problem through Reinforcement learning has been solved(see the readme in ps4(1)).
